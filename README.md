# Illa Movies

Illa Movies is an Android project that allows users to browse and discover a vast collection of movies. With Illa Movies, users can view a list of movies, mark them as favorites, and easily manage their favorite movies. The app utilizes a local Room database to store and retrieve favorite movie selections.

## Features

- **Favourite Movies**: Mark movies as favourites and access them conveniently.

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

## Usage

Upon launching the Illa Movies app, you will be presented with a list of movies. Each movie item will display relevant details such as the title, and overview.
